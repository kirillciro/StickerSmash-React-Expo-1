No environment variables with visibility "Plain text" and "Sensitive" found for the "production" environment on EAS.

- Incrementing buildNumber from 6 to 7.
✔ Incremented buildNumber from 6 to 7.
ios.buildNumber field in app config is ignored when version source is set to remote, but this value will still be in the manifest available via expo-constants. It's recommended to remove this value from app config.
✔ Using remote iOS credentials (Expo server)

If you provide your Apple account credentials we will be able to generate all necessary build credentials and fully validate them.
This is optional, but without Apple account access you will need to provide all the missing values manually and we can only run minimal validation on them.
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Do you want to log in to your Apple account?
